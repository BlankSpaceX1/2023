# Problem 1 (15 points)


## part (a)

For the function define below, calculate the exact number of atomic operations that are needed as a function of n (where n is the length of input list L). Please give explainations for every term.

```python
def f(L):
    newlist = []
    for i in L: 
        if i % 2 == 0:
            newlist.append(i)
    return newlist 
```

**Hint**:

1.  Creating a empty list costs 1 atomic operation.
2.  Focus on the worst case scenario.

```markdown
1 + 3 * n + 1 = 3n+2
```


## part (b)

What is the running time of the function in (a) using the Big-O notation?

```markdown
O(n)
```


# Problem 2 (25 points)


## part (a)

To check if there is any duplicates in a list, we have covered 3 different solutions. Can you come up with a solution that is more efficient than them?

**Hint**: sorting a list with `L.sort` takes $n\log_{2}n$ time.

```python
def timetrials(func, n, trials = 10):
    totaltime = 0
    L = list(range(n))
    for i in range(trials):
        start = time.time() 
        func(L)
        time_for_one_run = time.time() - start
        totaltime += time_for_one_run
    print("average = %10.7f for n = %d" % (totaltime/trials, n))

def check2(L, item, left = 0, right = None):
    if right is None: 
        right = len(L)
    if right - left == 0: # empty list
        return False
    if right - left == 1: # list of a single element
        return L[left] == item
    median = (right + left) // 2
    if item < L[median]:
        return check2(L, item, left, median)
    else:
        return check2(L, item, median, right)
    
def duplicates4(L):
    L.sort()
    n = len(L)
    for i in range(1,n):
        if check2(L, L[i], 0, i):
            return True
    return False
```


## part (b)

For `n = [800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800]`, use the timetrials function we defined in the notebook, calculate the running time for **duplicates2** and your function to verify that your function is indeed more efficient.

```python
def duplicates2(L):
    n = len(L)
    for i in range(1,n):
        for j in range(i):
            if L[i] == L[j]:
                return True
    return False

import time

for n in [50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200]:
    timetrials(duplicates2, n)

for n in [800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800]:
    timetrials(duplicates4, n)

```
