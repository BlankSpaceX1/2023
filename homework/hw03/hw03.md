# Problem 1 (30pts)

For this problem, you will create a **Point** class that can be used to generated any point in the cartesian coordinate. The followings are the attributes and methods that should be implemented in the **Point**:

- `__init__` (already done): To initialize a point object, you need to specify the x and y coordinates and assign to `self.x` and `self.y` attributes.
- Comparators methods:
  - Support the comparators < (`__lt__`), >(`__gt__`), and `==(=__eq__`).
  - p1 is less than p2 if its distance from the origin is less.
  - p1 is greater than p2 if its distance from the origin is greater.
  - p1 and p2 are equal if they are the same distance from the origin.
- `dist_from_origin` method:
  - Returns the Cartesian distance of this point from the origin

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    def dist_from_origin(self):
        return (self.x**2 + self.y**2)**0.5
    def __lt__(a, b):
        return a.dist_from_origin() < b.dist_from_origin()
    def __gt__(a, b):
        return a.dist_from_origin() > b.dist_from_origin()
    def __eq__(a, b):
        return a.dist_from_origin() == b.dist_from_origin()
```

# Problem 2 (50pts)

We have seen how to construct the **CheckingAccount** in the class. In this problem, you will construct the **SavingAccount**. Similar to the CheckingAccount class, since SavingAccount **is a** Account, so it should have all the attributes and methods defined for Account class. In addition, it should also have it's unique attributes and methods:

- The `interest_rate` for saving account is 10%.
- The minimum for saving account is 1000.
- Since rewards of a savings account were greater than those of a checking account, the bank allowed only one withdrawal from a savings account.
- When customer close the account, to reward the savings account owners, the bank added additional bonus of 15% (calculated off of the minimum amount held throughout the year) PLUS a fixed amount of 100 . Hence, for example, if the holdings were, 1000, 800, 1200, the owner of a savings account got 1200 + 800 x 0.1 + 800 x 0.15 + 100 = 1500.

## Requirements:

Your SavingAccount class should satisfy the followings:

- `__init__`:
  - To initialize a SavingAccount object, we need to specify (Already done):
    - `initial_amount`
    - `max_num_withdrawals` (default: 1)
    - `minimum` (default: 1000)
    - `interest_rate` (default: 0.1)
    - `bonus_contribution` (default: 0.15)
  - Inherit all the attributes and methods from its super class Account (Already done).
  - Additional attributes that are unique to SavingAccount:
    - `self._num_withdrawals` (set to 0 when initializing)
    - `self._max_num_withdrawals`
    - `self._bonus_contribution`
- `get_num_withdrawals` method:
  - Return the number of withdrawals.
- `withdraw` method:
  - Override the withdraw method from its super class.
- `add_bonus` method:
  - Increase the amount held by (percent bonus contribution) \* (minimal amount ever held) + 100.
- `close_account` method:
  - Override the `close_account` method from its super class.

## Remark

- import uuid module using `import uuid`.
- import Account class from the module named "Account" using `from Account import Account` (Make sure to put the Account.py file in the same folder as your homeowork file).
- Use the following structure to design you **SavingAccount** class. The comments are served as instructions for each methods. Use those instructions and insert you code right below each comment.

```python
import uuid
from Account import Account
class SavingAccount(Account):
    def __init__(self, initial_amount, max_num_withdrawals=1,
                 minimum=1000, interest_rate=0.10,
                 bonus_contribution=0.15):
        super().__init__(initial_amount, minimum, interest_rate)
        # 1) Set the number of withdrawals to 0 (only SavingsAccounts track the number
        #    of withdrawals
        self._num_withdrawals = 0
        # 2) Set the _max_num_withdrawals attribute to the value given in the argument
        #    of the constructor
        self._max_num_withdrawals = max_num_withdrawals
        # 3) Set the _bonus_contribution to the value given in the argument of
        #    the constructor
        self._bonus_contribution = bonus_contribution

    def get_num_withdrawals(self):
        # Simply return the number of withdrawals
        return self._num_withdrawals

    def withdraw(self, w_amount):
        # 1) If the number of withdrawals is larger than or equal to the maximal
        #  number of withdrawals allowed throw and exception:
        #  raise ValueError("Savings accounts allow only {} withdrawals.".format(self._max_num_withdrawals))
        if self._num_withdrawals >= self._max_num_withdrawals:
            raise ValueError("Savings accounts allow only {} withdrawals.".format(self._max_num_withdrawals))
        # 2) Increase the withdrawal counter by 1
        else: self._num_withdrawals += 1
        # 3) Call the parent's implementation of withdraw as it does the rest of
        #    things for us
        super().withdraw(w_amount)

    def add_bonus(self):
        # According to the banks rewards scheme, increase the amount held by the
        # (percent bonus contribution) * (minimal amount ever held) + 100
        self._amount_held += 0.15 * self._min_ever_held + 100

    def close_account(self):
        # 1) Add bonus
        self.add_bonus()
        # 2) Call the parent's close_account method as it does lots of stuff already
        return super().close_account()

a = SavingAccount(3000)
```

# Problem 3 (20 pts)

Recall the Monty Hall problem copied below:

*Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?*

Write a program to use simulation to approximate the probability of winning the car if you switch and the probability if you do not switch. Set the number of repetition to `1000` and set the random seed to:

```python
random.seed(2255)
```

```python
import random
random.seed(2255)
def mont():
    car = random.choice([1, 2, 3])
    choice = 1
    if car == 1:
        host = random.choice([2, 3])
    if car == 2:
        host = 3
    if car == 3:
        host = 2
    return host, car 

n_host_open3 = 0
n_car_door1 = 0
n_car_door2 = 0
N = 1000
random.seed(2255)
for i in range(N):
    host, car = mont()
    if host == 3:
        n_host_open3 += 1
        if car == 1:
            n_car_door1 += 1
        if car == 2:
            n_car_door2 += 1

res = [n_car_door2 / n_host_open3, n_car_door1 / n_host_open3] 
print(res)
```
