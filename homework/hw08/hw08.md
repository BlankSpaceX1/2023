# Problem 1 (40 pts)

A professor measured the time (in seconds) required to catch a falling yard stick for 12 randomly selected students' dominant hand and nondominant hand. The professor claims that the reaction time in an individual's dominant hand is less than the reaction time in their nondominant hand. Test the claim at the $\alpha$ = 0.05 level of significance.

| Student | Dominent Hand $x₁$ | Nondominent Hand $x₂$ |
|------- |------------------ |--------------------- |
| 1       | 0.177              | 0.179                 |
| 2       | 0.210              | 0.202                 |
| 3       | 0.189              | 0.184                 |
| 4       | 0.198              | 0.215                 |
| 5       | 0.194              | 0.193                 |
| 6       | 0.160              | 0.194                 |
| 7       | 0.163              | 0.160                 |
| 8       | 0.166              | 0.209                 |
| 9       | 0.152              | 0.164                 |
| 10      | 0.190              | 0.210                 |
| 11      | 0.172              | 0.197                 |
| 12      | 0.186              | 0.208                 |

Use the above data to answer the following questions.


## Part 1 - 10 pts

What is the null and alternative hypothesis?


### answer

Let $\mu_1$ be the population average reaction time for the dominant hand, and $\mu_2$ be the population average reaction time for the nondominant hand. $$H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2 \rightarrow d = 0$$ $$H_1: \mu_1 < \mu_2 \rightarrow d < 0$$


## Part 2 - 10 pts

What is the correct test to perform? Test if the underlying assumption is satisfied?


### answer

1.  **Paired t test**, since two population are dependent.

2.  With a small sample size of 12, it is necessary to check the normality assumption (on d).

```python
import scipy.stats as scs
import statsmodels.stats.api as sms
import pandas as pd
dominant = pd.Series([0.177, 0.210, 0.189, 0.198, 0.194, 0.16, 0.163, 0.166, 0.152, 0.19, 0.172, 0.186])
nondominant = pd.Series([0.179, 0.202, 0.184, 0.215, 0.193, 0.194, 0.16, 0.209, 0.164, 0.210, 0.197,0.208])
d = dominant-nondominant
scs.shapiro(d)
```

```
ShapiroResult(statistic=0.9432522654533386, pvalue=0.5413171052932739)
```

The p-value is large, indicating that the normality assumption is appropriate.


## Part 3 - 20 pts

Conduct the test to test the claim.


### answer

```python
t_score, p_value = scs.ttest_1samp(d, popmean=0, alternative='less')
print('The test statistics is {}, and the p value is {}.'.format(float(t_score.round(4)), float(p_value.round(4))))
```

```
The test statistics is -2.7759, and the p value is 0.009.
```

The p-value is small so reject the null.
